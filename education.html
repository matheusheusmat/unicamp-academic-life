                While being a student at Unicamp, you shall be prepared to walk - A LOT. 
                The campus is big, and you are in a city in which sun and heat are 
                issues to be worried all year long. Of course, it varies from semester to 
                semester, but it happens to have a class on one side of the Uni (lets 
                abbreviate) and subsequently, another one on the other side. I strongly 
                recommend you to have a bicycle, because it cuts the time you would spend
                walking in more than half. Warning given, let's talk about the classrooms.

                The picture above portraits the "basic cycle" (Ciclo Básico - CB) classrooms. 
                It is where the undergraduates have the most of their theorical classes. 
                The first four semesters of engineering courses have calculus, physics, 
                geometry, algebra, and other common subjects' classes in there. It is shared
                with other courses as well - mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, music bachelors...

                <h4>Institute of Computing (Instituto de Computação - IC)</h4>
                <img src="https://ic.unicamp.br/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fachada-Ic.jpg" alt="Institute of Computing facade" width="90%">
                <p>
                Talking specifically about my course now, I'd like to show you the <b>Institute 
                of Computing (IC)</b>, which facade is in the photo above. It is 
                one of the best places for a student of my course or of the Computer Science
                course to study. It has a lot of computer labs with air conditioner and, most
                of the times, silence. Some practical programming classes are also in there.
                It's a newly remodeled place, so everything there - from chairs and tables to wall 
                paintings and computers - is new and beautiful, I should say.
            </p>

                <p>
                The only issue with the IC is that it's located very far from the CB classrooms,
                on the top of a hill, whilst the rest of the Uni is in lower ground. So going 
                there by bicycle or foot is a hard time, specially in hot days. But it provides
                an amazing panoramic view of the Uni and the city that surrounds it. Going there
                to watch the sunset is a must!

                <h4>School of Electrical and Computing Engineering (Faculdade de Engenharia Elétrica e 
                de Computação - FEEC)</h4>
                <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YDu-ffwH71c/UE_mN3JHGgI/AAAAAAAAAA8/2CuA_NF7c0E/s1600/IMG_8874.JPG" alt="School of Electrical and Computing Engineering facade" width="90%">
                <p>
                The School of Electrical and Computing Engineering (Faculdade de Engenharia Elétrica e 
                de Computação - FEEC) is another place a student of my course should be familiar with. 
                The main entrance is shown above. The school itself is very big and consists of several 
                building blocks: the professors' rooms block, the classrooms block, the research labs 
                blocks, and other purposes blocks. The classrooms there are big, amphitheater-styled, 
                not as new as the IC ones, but they serve their purpose well.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <img src="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/sites/default/files/inline-images/posse_feec_comunidade_cinterna_2_20190424_0.jpg" alt="A classroom at FEEC" width="90%">
                <p>
                The issue with FEEC are the computer labs - the machines there are very outdated and slow,
                and the lack of studying places. There is no studying room, you should study in big tables 
                located in the corridors. It's kind of hard to focus. At least there is a new lab in there,
                called "LED-IT", which has nice tables to study and a <i>functional</i> air conditioner. It
                is a small room, but a cool place to study if empty.
