                <h4>University Restaurants (Restaurantes Universit√°rios)</h4>

                    The standard choice for the students. The university restaurants provide a low-cost meal to undergraduates
                    and post-graduates. As of December 2023, the cost of lunch or dinner is only 3 brazilian reais 
                    (just 62 US cents!). Of course, some meals are better than other ones. For some meals, the price 
                    is justifiable, but for others...<br>
                    There are three restaurants around the campus. Conveniently for a computer engineering student, 
                    there is one near the Basic Cycle, the other one near the IC, and the last one near the FEEC. 
                    Above, RS (near to the IC) is pictured, but there is also RU (near to CB) and RA (near to FEEC).

                <p>
                    Only one canteen is active inside the campus, as result of the COVID pandemic. It's located in front of
                    the Biology Institute. But, there are plans and working sites going on to open new ones. As an
                    alternative, you can find many vending machines throughout the campus, in every institute, that
                    sell a wide variety of snacks and drinks. There are coffee machines, too.

                <img src="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/sites/default/files/inline-images/Man_20230314_2_Cantinas_scarpa_AJS_2834_interna.jpg" alt="Open food fair at Unicamp" width="90%">
                <p>
                    The food fairs are a tradition in brazilian cities, and it isn't different at Unicamp. From Tuesday
                    to Thursday, you can enjoy a wide variety of brazilian and other countries' typical foods visiting 
                    the many stands mounted during these days. Don't forget to taste the classical, omnipresent food
                    in all of the fairs: pastel, a deep fried dough filled with what you want cheese, meat,
                    ham, chicken, or even the most creative things like banana with cinnamon, chocolate, and so on.
                    Definitely a must-try.
