                    My name is <b>Matheus</b> and I am a student at Universidade Estadual de
                    Campinas - Unicamp. It is a public university located in the city of
                    Campinas, state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I would like to share to you some
                    of my experiences of living and studying at this institution, and some
                    facts, too.

                    The Universidade Estadual de Campinas is a great place to live, socialize, learn and grow academically,
                    professionally and as a person. This is the life I chose to myself, although it is difficult
                    sometimes. But, what keeps me going on is the faith in the reward. A successful carrer won't start without
                    time and hard work. And this place is a great one to get it started.

                    I chose the Computer Engineering course because I am a very curious person
                    and had the desire to work in something related with technology, although I'm
                    still discovering in which area I want to work and invest in the near future.
                    Each day I pass there, I discover something new. My interests are processor
                    architechtures, scientific programming and artificial intelligence.
                    I hope this website will help you to know more about me and my academic life.
