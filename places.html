                <h4>Exploratory Museum of Sciences (Museu Exploratório de Ciências)</h4>
                <img src="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/sites/default/files/inline-images/atu_calourada-museu_20220317_3.jpg" alt="Into the Exploratory Museum of Sciences" width="90%">
                <p>
                    A nice and calm open air museum, with the option of guided visiting, to learn more about natural
                    sciences. There you can find interactive experiments of sound, waves, astronomy and many
                    more. Also, it's a nice place to have a family or romantic picnic and undoubtedly the 
                    best view of the Uni and the Barão Geraldo district. Personally, the best sunset I've seen 
                    in my life was watched from there, thanks to its location, the highest point of the University.

                <h4>Peace Square (Praça da Paz)</h4>
                <img src="https://www.prefeitura.unicamp.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/20230116_120044-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="The open-air theater at Peace Square, Unicamp" width="90%">
                <p>
                    The name is self-explanatory. Trees, tracks for jogging, silence to take a break. Just be aware
                    of the red ants, they bite! It is located between the Chemistry Institute and the rectory.
                    There are several activities in a small open-air theater there, too.

                <h4>Central Library "Cesar Lattes" (Biblioteca Central Cesar Lattes)</h4>
                <img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zltho9g_1HU/W_0hwtfyrtI/AAAAAAAAvt4/byIN9V0F0D4pgflAHpQH35KflVvx1oH0QCLcBGAs/s1600/Biblioteca%2BCesar%2BLattes02%2B20Novembro2018.jpg" alt="Central Library Cesar Lattes entrance at Unicamp" width="90%">
                <p>
                    It is a big, 4-floor library, located in front of the Basic Cycle square. Inside, there are the
                    books avaiable for lending (exclusive to students), the Institute of Arts museum, a book store,
                    and often some exhibition of museum pieces, science, and other things. A must-go when visiting!
